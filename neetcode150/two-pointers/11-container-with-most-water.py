Problem: https://leetcode.cn/problems/container-with-most-water/
Difficulty: Medium

Solution #1: Two Pointers
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

Use two pointers starting at opposite ends of the array to find the maximum water container area.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize left pointer at start (0) and right pointer at end (n-1) for maximum width
2. Calculate area: width x min(height[left], height[right])
3. Move the pointer at the shorter line inward, as keeping it would only yield smaller areas
4. Repeat until pointers meet

Key insight: Moving the shorter line pointer eliminates all suboptimal containers that use
that line with smaller widths, ensuring we find the optimal solution without checking all O(nÂ²) pairs.
